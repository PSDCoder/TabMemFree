TabMemFree
----

TabMemFree - is a Chrome extension that lowers RAM consumption and CPU load by &quot;parking&quot; tabs inactive for some time.
Parking is made by forwarding tab to an empty page similar to `about:blank`.
Later on, when you click on a parked tab, it is sent back to the original page by going one stap back in it's history.
The side effect is that &quot;forward&quot; history of tab may be lost, but this could be prevented by option in extension settings.</p>
